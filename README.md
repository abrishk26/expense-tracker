# Expense Tracker

The **Expense Tracker** is a web application I developed as part of my internship application for **Shega**. This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application using modern technologies like **Next.js** and **Supabase**. It showcases my skills in frontend development, backend integration, and database management, all of which are essential for the role Iâ€™m applying for.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up or Log In**:
   - Users can create a new account or log in to an existing one.
   - After signing up, an activation email is sent to the provided email address. **Please wait a few minutes for the email to arrive**.
   - Once the account is activated, users can log in and access their dashboard.

2. **Add Expenses**:
   - Users can log expenses with details such as amount, category, and date.
   - **Note**: Expenses can only be added if a budget for the corresponding category exists.

3. **Set Budgets**:
   - Users can define monthly budget goals for different categories.
   - **Note**: A budget cannot be added again for the same year, month, and category combination.

4. **Track Spending**:
   - Users can view their spending trends and budget progress on the dashboard.
   - The dashboard provides a clear representation of expenses and budgets.

### Additional Notes:
- After a successful login, users remain logged in until they manually log out.
- **Live Demo**: [View the live demo of the project here](https://expense-tracker-app-sjyx.vercel.app/).
