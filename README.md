# Expense Tracker

The **Expense Tracker** is a web application I developed as part of my internship application for **Shega**. This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application using modern technologies like **Next.js** and **Supabase**. It showcases my skills in frontend development, backend integration, and database management, all of which are essential for the role Iâ€™m applying for.
